# ScoreMe_Hackathon
(Respected Sir/Mam,
I used Google Collab for this hackathon and then transfered the code to GitHub. So I have uploaded the code in both the Google Collab and GitHub files respectively for better understanding. Also, the PPT contains snapshots from the Google Collab part. Thank you so much for your understanding and support on this matter.)
# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

# Overview
This project aims to develop a tool for extracting tables from PDFs without relying on traditional tools like Tabula or Camelot. The tool utilizes PyMuPDF for PDF parsing and pandas for data manipulation to accurately identify, extract, and export tables into Excel sheets. The objective is to enhance document processing efficiency by automating the extraction of structured data from PDF documents.

# Features
1. PDF Parsing: Utilizes PyMuPDF to extract text and layout information from PDF pages.
2. Table Detection: Identifies tables within PDFs, including tables with borders, borderless tables, and irregularly shaped tables.
3. Data Extraction: Parses table data into structured formats using pandas DataFrames.
4. Excel Export: Outputs extracted tables into Excel files, maintaining data integrity and structure.
5. Data Cleaning: Handles illegal characters and formatting discrepancies within extracted data.
6. Custom Solution: Provides an alternative to traditional PDF table extraction tools by leveraging Python libraries and custom algorithms.

# Tools and Libraries Used for the Project
1. PyMuPDF: Python library for parsing PDF documents and extracting text and layout information.
2. pandas: Data manipulation library used for organizing extracted table data into structured formats.
3. openpyxl: Library for Excel file manipulation, used for exporting extracted tables into Excel sheets.

# Inputs and Outputs for the Project
1. For this project, sample pdfs titled 'test3.pdf', 'test5.pdf' and 'test6.pdf' are used as inputs.
2. And the outputs for these test files are stored as 'output_test3.xlsx', 'output_test5.xlsx' and 'output_test6.xlsx' respectively.
